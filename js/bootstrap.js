      <p>Hello, welcome to my site.</p>
      <p>On this site is published free winning correct-score football(soccer) system and program for roulette that can be used for winning in online roulette. I also offer service in making program for online-roulette systems.</p>
      <p>So, let's begin.</p>
      <p>The correct score winning football system</p>
      <p>If your question is "Is it possible to beat the gambling industry?" and "How?" I will answer it below with the free football correct score system to prove you - that is possible. </p>
      <p>So, let's get to the point. The system. Choose dominating football team from the one of the reliable leagues (could be f.e. Real Madrid, or FC Barcelona or Bayern Munich etc.) (Dosn't have to be the first team if there are two or even three teams in this league that win very often.)</p>
      <p>Then we concentrate on most often correct scores of that team in the league (club's domestic league, La Liga, Bundesliga etc.), both home and away games, we could choose probably 2-0 or 2-1 or 3-0 or even 1-0 for some teams that often win by scoring small and keeping the advantage over the course of game. (No Cups, no European championships, only League games.)</p>
      <p>Then we play the progression on only one of the selected scores (f.e. if you choosed 2-1 you play only on that score), through 15 games most. (Stop if you didn't win in 15 games.) (The original formula is ((nx2)+1) where the n is average odds for most common score at bookmaker and the final result is the maximum games played in progression and gives ~2x advantage over the bookmaker(when the house edge of bookmaker is calculated in), so you can adjust progression a bit if you want.).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 text-justify">
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Basically It is like this(for example we will take 2-0 score with avg. odds of 7.00 and 5€ your starting bet); bookmaker says: "I'm offering you 30€ profits for you to play the 2-0 score on any World Class team(f.e. Barcelona) through 15 games (you can even change the formula for higher odds of winning f.e. nx2.5 or nx3 etc. which can give even bigger advantage) and all you need to do is invest a bit more money every time(laying against you) and I(bookmaker) bet your team won't achieve the 2-0 score in 15 rounds, not even once". Crazy from the bookmaker, right? Statistic also says it is crazy from the bookmaker.</p>
      <p>The progression should be flat-win progression. You should choose progression based on your money managment, it can be played for small amount or higher amounts if you have more money. Before that check the bookmakers limits and calculate flat-win stake based on avarege odds for that score of selected team and your bank. For extra ensurance choose 3+ teams so you diversify your bank that you keep positive bankroll if one of your team loses. Play with respectable bookmakers with high odds on correct score (and high limits on payout if you have bigger bank). </p>
      <p>For extra saftey you can wait for couple of leauge games at the beginning of the season to see how your team started and then put money on them if you are not sure how transfers and other factors will affect the team this season (f.e. it could change the most often score if team brings two world class-atackers and then team could score 4 goals per game averege except 2 or 3 on average game or changing the coach and style of play could affect the most common score too, f.e. from attacking to extra attacking or vice versa) but nonetheless that should not affect too much the (more or less)wisely chosen correct score.<br>

      <p>I also sell the winning roulette program, the program that actually wins, like this football system, and make roulette systems (I program them on demand). </p>
      <p>For programing the roulette systems contact me on the email adress, and see more under online-roulette section of the webpage. </p>
      <p>Welcome to my online-roulette software section of the website.</p>
      <p>On this part of website is video of me winning in online-roulette with my software.</p> 
      <p>The price is 25€ for all three versions of it (2 diversified versions for smaller monitors, and one for unified for bigger monitors). Please read the instructions that will be sent to you. You can use the program on 2 devices.</p>
      <p>Nr. of copies left: 1200 (updated manually)</p>
      <p>For making systems contact me on my email with that subject. Please note, that I only informatize succesfull systems and strategies in online roulette and not basic ones. (There should be a increased mathematical probability of win because if some circumstances appear or some pattern that occurs in cycles, that is proven, or something like that, and I need to see and aprove those things before programing some strategy.) If you have an unusual succesfull system or strategy please contact me, I will see what I can do about it. If not you can buy my program based on those kind of systems. The price for making a system is 15€ per system line that is layed out in simple GUI. </p>
